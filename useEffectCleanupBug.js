This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error. This can happen if the cleanup function tries to access a component variable that has already been unmounted or if there's an unexpected error within the cleanup logic itself.  For example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = someDataStream.subscribe(data => {
    // ... handle data
  });

  return () => {
    subscription.unsubscribe(); // this might throw if subscription is already unsubscribed
  };
}, []);
```

The error message might not be very descriptive, making it difficult to pinpoint the cause.
